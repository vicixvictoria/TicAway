# TicAway 
Prototypical mobile App for support in Tourette Syndrome and Tic-Disorders in the course of the core-subject specilaization of my masters studies.

## Description 
TicAway is a prototypical app which was developed as a support for patients suffering tourette syndrome or other tic-disorders with the inclusion of comprehensive behavioral interventions for tics (CBITs). The prototype was implemented with SWIFT for iOS.

## Features
- **Tic Logbook**: This feature should function as a diary or logbook about tics, were users can enter their tics with date, time, duration and if it is a new one. They can also add the premonitory urge to a tic, which is important to do a succesful CBIT therapy.
- **Awareness Training**: Awareness Training is a commonly used exercise in CBIT therapy and this feature should enable the users to also do those tranings efficiently at home. Therefore the app shows a timer and the possibility to log all the tics and premonitory urges of a session. Furthermore it provides tipps and tricks for trainings like this.
- **Relaxation**: This feature provides three categories for relaxation trainings. **Acute** should support thre users during an acute tic attack with guided breatging techniques. **Breathing** teaches the users different techniques to relaxe the tics and **PMRT** - progressive muscle relaxation training teaches the users how to correctly do PMRT trainings and how they can help with tics. 
- **Information**: This feature aims to include psychoeducation where the users can read up on their condition and the different therapy possibilities.
